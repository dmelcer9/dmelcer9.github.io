What if you didn't have to install RDP software to view the screen of another computer? What if you could just use SSH or something to share your screen? What would that even look like? This. This is what it would look like.

As it turns out, [your (linux) terminal](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/console_codes.4.html) provides enough functionality to allow you to view a live desktop feed, handle keypresses and mouse inputs, and automatically adjust the display when the window is resized.
