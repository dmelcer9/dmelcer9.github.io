(Abstract) Shielding is an effective method for ensuring safety in multi-agent
domains; however, its applicability has previously been limited
to environments for which an approximate discrete model and
safety specification are known in advance. We present a method
for learning shields in cooperative fully-observable multi-agent
environments where neither a model nor safety specification are
provided, using architectural constraints to realize several important properties of a shield. We show through a series of experiments
that our learned shielding method is effective at significantly reducing safety violations, while largely maintaining the ability of an
underlying reinforcement learning agent to optimize for reward.
