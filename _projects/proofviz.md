(Abstract) 
We introduce ProofViz, an extension to the Cur proof assistant ecosystem that enables interactive visualization and exploration of in-progress proofs.
The tool displays a representation of the underlying proof tree, information about each node in the tree, and the values of partially-completed proof terms.
Users can interact with the proof by executing tactics, changing the focus to any hole, and undoing or redoing their previous interactions.
We anticipate that ProofViz will be useful both as a tool to introduce tactic proofs to learners of dependent type systems, 
and as a mechanism for advanced users looking for insight into the effects of their custom tactics.
